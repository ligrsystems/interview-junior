# Welcome to the LIGR Junior interview

This is a small test written in Javascript, Node and Express.
Take your time, relax, and most of all have fun.


## Setup
Use yarn or npm to install packages
```
yarn
```

## Running
```
yarn start
```

## The challenge

This is a somewhat broken API :(. We need you to fix it.
There are 3 endpoints:
`GET /api/users/`: This returns a list of the users
`POST /api/users/`: Creates a user
`GET /api/users/:id`: Looks a user up by the id

There is also a small form for adding a new user. This can be found on the root.

`http://localhost:9999/`

Your challenge is to fix the form and the endpoints.
